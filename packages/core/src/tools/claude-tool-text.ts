/** Canonical Claude Code tool descriptions (before Kako adaptation). */

export const CLAUDE_READ_DESCRIPTION = `Reads a file from the local filesystem.

- \`file_path\` must be an absolute path.
- Reads up to 2000 lines by default.
- When you already know which part of the file you need, only read that part. This can be important for larger files.
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Reads images (PNG, JPG, …) and presents them visually. Reads PDFs via the \`pages\` parameter (e.g. "1-5", max 20 pages/request; required for PDFs over 10 pages). Reads Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) as cells with outputs.
- Reading a directory, a missing file, or an empty file returns an error or system reminder rather than content.
- Do NOT re-read a file you just edited to verify — Edit/Write would have errored if the change failed, and the harness tracks file state for you.`;

export const CLAUDE_WRITE_DESCRIPTION = `Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.`;

export const CLAUDE_EDIT_DESCRIPTION = `Performs exact string replacement in a file.

- You must Read the file in this conversation before editing, or the call will fail.
- \`old_string\` must match the file exactly, including indentation, and be unique — the edit fails otherwise. Strip the Read line prefix (line number + tab) before matching.
- \`replace_all: true\` replaces every occurrence instead.`;

export const CLAUDE_NOTEBOOK_EDIT_DESCRIPTION = `Replaces, inserts, or deletes a single cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file).

Usage:
- You must use the Read tool on the notebook in this conversation before editing — this tool will fail otherwise.
- \`notebook_path\` must be an absolute path.
- \`cell_id\` is the \`id\` attribute shown in the Read tool's \`<cell id="...">\` output. It is required for \`replace\` and \`delete\`.
- \`edit_mode\` defaults to \`replace\`. Use \`insert\` to add a new cell after the cell with the given \`cell_id\` (or at the beginning of the notebook if \`cell_id\` is omitted) — \`cell_type\` is required when inserting. Use \`delete\` to remove the cell.`;

export const CLAUDE_ENTER_WORKTREE_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool ONLY when explicitly instructed to work in a worktree — either by the user directly, or by project instructions (CLAUDE.md / memory). This tool creates an isolated git worktree and switches the current session into it.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly says "worktree" (e.g., "start a worktree", "work in a worktree", "create a worktree", "use a worktree")
- CLAUDE.md or memory instructions direct you to work in a worktree for the current task

## When NOT to Use

- The user asks to create a branch, switch branches, or work on a different branch — use git commands instead
- The user asks to fix a bug or work on a feature — use normal git workflow unless worktrees are explicitly requested by the user or project instructions
- Never use this tool unless "worktree" is explicitly mentioned by the user or in CLAUDE.md / memory instructions

## Requirements

- Must be in a git repository, OR have WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks configured in settings.json
- Must not already be in a worktree session when creating a new worktree (\`name\`); switching into another existing worktree via \`path\` is allowed

## Behavior

- In a git repository: creates a new git worktree inside \`.claude/worktrees/\` on a new branch. The base ref is governed by the \`worktree.baseRef\` setting: \`fresh\` (default) branches from origin/<default-branch>; \`head\` branches from your current local HEAD
- Outside a git repository: delegates to WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks for VCS-agnostic isolation
- Switches the session's working directory to the new worktree
- Use ExitWorktree to leave the worktree mid-session (keep or remove). On session exit, if still in the worktree, the user will be prompted to keep or remove it

## Entering an existing worktree

Pass \`path\` instead of \`name\` to switch the session into a worktree that already exists (e.g., one you just created with \`git worktree add\`). The path must appear in \`git worktree list\` for the current repository — paths that are not registered worktrees of this repo are rejected. ExitWorktree will not remove a worktree entered this way; use \`action: "keep"\` to return to the original directory.

Switching with \`path\` also works when the session is already in a worktree (the previous worktree is left on disk, untouched, and only the new one is tracked for exit-time cleanup), and from agents whose working directory was pinned at launch (subagent isolation or explicit cwd). In both cases the target must be a worktree under \`.claude/worktrees/\` of the same repository, and from a pinned agent the switch only affects this agent, not the parent session. After a further switch, previously-visited worktrees are no longer writable — re-issue EnterWorktree with \`path\` to return to one.

## Parameters

- \`name\` (optional): A name for a new worktree. If neither \`name\` nor \`path\` is provided, a random name is generated.
- \`path\` (optional): Path to an existing worktree of the current repository to enter instead of creating one. Mutually exclusive with \`name\`.`;

export const CLAUDE_ENTER_WORKTREE_NAME_DESCRIPTION =
  'Optional name for a new worktree. Each "/" separated segment may contain only letters, digits, dots, underscores, and dashes; max 64 chars total. A random name is generated if not provided. Mutually exclusive with `path`.';

export const CLAUDE_ENTER_WORKTREE_PATH_DESCRIPTION =
  "Path to an existing worktree of the current repository to switch into instead of creating a new one. Must appear in `git worktree list` for the current repo. Mutually exclusive with `name`.";

export const CLAUDE_EXIT_WORKTREE_DESCRIPTION = `Exit a worktree session created by EnterWorktree and return the session to the original working directory.

## Scope

This tool ONLY operates on worktrees created by EnterWorktree in this session. It will NOT touch:
- Worktrees you created manually with \`git worktree add\`
- Worktrees from a previous session (even if created by EnterWorktree then)
- The directory you're in if EnterWorktree was never called

If called outside an EnterWorktree session, the tool is a **no-op**: it reports that no worktree session is active and takes no action. Filesystem state is unchanged.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly asks to "exit the worktree", "leave the worktree", "go back", or otherwise end the worktree session
- Do NOT call this proactively — only when the user asks

## Parameters

- \`action\` (required): \`"keep"\` or \`"remove"\`
  - \`"keep"\` — leave the worktree directory and branch intact on disk. Use this if the user wants to come back to the work later, or if there are changes to preserve.
  - \`"remove"\` — delete the worktree directory and its branch. Use this for a clean exit when the work is done or abandoned.
- \`discard_changes\` (optional, default false): only meaningful with \`action: "remove"\`. If the worktree has uncommitted files or commits not on the original branch, the tool will REFUSE to remove it unless this is set to \`true\`. If the tool returns an error listing changes, confirm with the user before re-invoking with \`discard_changes: true\`.

## Behavior

- Restores the session's working directory to where it was before EnterWorktree
- Clears CWD-dependent caches (system prompt sections, memory files, plans directory) so the session state reflects the original directory
- If a tmux session was attached to the worktree: killed on \`remove\`, left running on \`keep\` (its name is returned so the user can reattach)
- Once exited, EnterWorktree can be called again to create a fresh worktree`;

export const CLAUDE_ENTER_PLAN_MODE_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
   - Example: "Add a logout button" - where should it go? What should happen on click?
   - Example: "Add form validation" - what rules? What error messages?

2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.
   - Example: "Improve performance" - many optimization strategies possible

3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
   - Example: "Update the login flow" - what exactly should change?
   - Example: "Refactor this component" - what's the target architecture?

4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling
   - Example: "Implement state management" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution

5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
   - Example: "Refactor the authentication system"
   - Example: "Add a new API endpoint with tests"

6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Example: "Fix the bug in checkout" - need to investigate root cause

7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways
   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead
   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool with explore agent instead)

## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using \`find\`/Glob, \`grep\`/Grep, and Read
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design an implementation approach
4. Present your plan to the user for approval
5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches
6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

User: "Optimize the database queries"
- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

User: "Implement dark mode"
- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates

User: "Update the error handling in the API"
- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning

## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase`;

export const CLAUDE_EXIT_PLAN_MODE_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message
- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote
- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve
- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it

## When to Use This Tool
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

## Before Using This Tool
Ensure your plan is complete and unambiguous:
- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use AskUserQuestion first (in earlier phases)
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval

**Important:** Do NOT use AskUserQuestion to ask "Is this plan okay?" or "Should I proceed?" - that's exactly what THIS tool does. ExitPlanMode inherently requests user approval of your plan.

## Examples

1. Initial task: "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.
2. Initial task: "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.
3. Initial task: "Add a new feature to handle user authentication" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.`;

export const CLAUDE_EXIT_PLAN_MODE_ALLOWED_PROMPTS_DESCRIPTION =
  "Prompt-based permissions needed to implement the plan. These describe categories of actions rather than specific commands.";

export const CLAUDE_ASK_USER_QUESTION_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool only when you are blocked on a decision that is genuinely the user's to make: one you cannot resolve from the request, the code, or sensible defaults.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Plan mode note: To switch into plan mode, use EnterPlanMode (not this tool). Once in plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements or choose between approaches BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this tool to ask "Is my plan ready?", "Should I proceed?", or otherwise reference "the plan" in questions — the user cannot see the plan until you call ExitPlanMode for approval.

Reserve this for decisions where the user's answer changes what you do next — not for choices with a conventional default or facts you can verify in the codebase yourself. In those cases pick the obvious option, mention it in your response, and proceed.

Preview feature:
Use the optional \`preview\` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

Preview content is rendered as markdown in a monospace box. Multi-line text with newlines is supported. When any option has a preview, the UI switches to a side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and preview on the right. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).`;

export const CLAUDE_AGENT_DESCRIPTION = `Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types are listed in <system-reminder> messages in the conversation.

When using the Agent tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.

## When to use

Reach for this when the task matches an available agent type, when you have independent work to run in parallel, or when answering would mean reading across several files — delegate it and you keep the conclusion, not the file dumps. For a single-fact lookup where you already know the file, symbol, or value, search directly. Once you've delegated a search, don't also run it yourself — wait for the result.

- The agent's final message is returned to you as the tool result; it is not shown to the user — relay what matters.
- Use SendMessage with the agent's ID or name to continue a previously spawned agent with its context intact; a new Agent call starts fresh.
- \`isolation: "worktree"\` gives the agent its own git worktree (auto-cleaned if unchanged).
- \`run_in_background: true\` runs the agent asynchronously; you'll be notified when it completes.`;

export const CLAUDE_BASH_DESCRIPTION = `Executes a bash command and returns its output.

- Working directory persists between calls, but prefer absolute paths — \`cd\` in a compound command can trigger a permission prompt. Shell state (env vars, functions) does not persist; the shell is initialized from the user's profile.
- IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run \`cat\`, \`head\`, \`tail\`, \`sed\`, \`awk\`, or \`echo\` commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user.
- \`timeout\` is in milliseconds: default 120000, max 600000.
- \`run_in_background\` runs the command detached: it keeps running across turns and re-invokes you when it exits. No \`&\` needed. Foreground \`sleep\` is blocked; use Monitor with an until-loop to wait on a condition.

# Git
- Interactive flags (\`-i\`, e.g. \`git rebase -i\`, \`git add -i\`) are not supported in this environment.
- Use the \`gh\` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, API).
- Commit or push only when the user asks. If on the default branch, branch first.
- End git commit messages with:
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
- End PR bodies with:
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`;

export const CLAUDE_SKILL_DESCRIPTION = `Execute a skill within the main conversation

When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

Invoke skills using this tool with the skill name only (no arguments). When you invoke a skill, you will see <command-{name}> is running… followed by the expanded prompt. The skill's prompt will expand and provide detailed instructions on how to complete the task.

Only use skills listed in <available_skills> below. Do not invoke a skill that is already running. Do not use this tool for built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.).`;

export const CLAUDE_CRON_CREATE_DESCRIPTION = `Schedule a prompt to be enqueued at a future time. Use for both recurring schedules and one-shot reminders.

Uses standard 5-field cron in the user's local timezone: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week. "0 9 * * *" means 9am local — no timezone conversion needed.

## One-shot tasks (recurring: false)

For "remind me at X" or "at <time>, do Y" requests — fire once then auto-delete.
Pin minute/hour/day-of-month/month to specific values:
  "remind me at 2:30pm today to check the deploy" → cron: "30 14 <today_dom> <today_month> *", recurring: false
  "tomorrow morning, run the smoke test" → cron: "57 8 <tomorrow_dom> <tomorrow_month> *", recurring: false

## Recurring jobs (recurring: true, the default)

For "every N minutes" / "every hour" / "weekdays at 9am" requests:
  "*/5 * * * *" (every 5 min), "0 * * * *" (hourly), "0 9 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 9am local)

## Avoid the :00 and :30 minute marks when the task allows it

Every user who asks for "9am" gets \`0 9\`, and every user who asks for "hourly" gets \`0 *\` — which means requests from across the planet land on the API at the same instant. When the user's request is approximate, pick a minute that is NOT 0 or 30:
  "every morning around 9" → "57 8 * * *" or "3 9 * * *" (not "0 9 * * *")
  "hourly" → "7 * * * *" (not "0 * * * *")
  "in an hour or so, remind me to..." → pick whatever minute you land on, don't round

Only use minute 0 or 30 when the user names that exact time and clearly means it ("at 9:00 sharp", "at half past", coordinating with a meeting). When in doubt, nudge a few minutes early or late — the user will not notice, and the fleet will.

## Session-only

Jobs live only in this Claude session — nothing is written to disk, and the job is gone when Claude exits.

## Not for live watching

CronCreate re-runs a prompt at fixed wall-clock intervals. To watch a log file, process, or command output and be notified the moment something changes, use the Monitor tool instead — Monitor streams events as they happen; cron polls on a schedule.

## Runtime behavior

Jobs only fire while the REPL is idle (not mid-query). The scheduler adds a small deterministic jitter on top of whatever you pick: recurring tasks fire up to 10% of their period late (max 15 min); one-shot tasks landing on :00 or :30 fire up to 90 s early. Picking an off-minute is still the bigger lever.

Recurring tasks auto-expire after 7 days — they fire one final time, then are deleted. This bounds session lifetime. Tell the user about the 7-day limit when scheduling recurring jobs.

Returns a job ID you can pass to CronDelete.`;

export const CLAUDE_CRON_CREATE_DURABLE_DESCRIPTION =
  "true = persist to .claude/scheduled_tasks.json and survive restarts. false (default) = in-memory only, dies when this Claude session ends. Use true only when the user asks the task to survive across sessions.";

export const CLAUDE_CRON_DELETE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Cancel a cron job previously scheduled with CronCreate. Removes it from the in-memory session store.";

export const CLAUDE_CRON_LIST_DESCRIPTION =
  "List all cron jobs scheduled via CronCreate in this session.";

export const CLAUDE_MONITOR_DESCRIPTION = `Start a background monitor that streams events from a long-running script. Each stdout line is an event — you keep working and notifications arrive in the chat. Events arrive on their own schedule and are not replies from the user, even if one lands while you're waiting for the user to answer a question.

Pick by how many notifications you need:
- **One** ("tell me when the server is ready / the build finishes") → use **Bash with \`run_in_background\`** and a command that exits when the condition is true, e.g. \`until grep -q "Ready in" dev.log; do sleep 0.5; done\`. You get a single completion notification when it exits.
- **One per occurrence, indefinitely** ("tell me every time an ERROR line appears") → Monitor with an unbounded command (\`tail -f\`, \`inotifywait -m\`, \`while true\`).
- **One per occurrence, until a known end** ("emit each CI step result, stop when the run completes") → Monitor with a command that emits lines and then exits.

Your script's stdout is the event stream. Each line becomes a notification. Exit ends the watch.

  # Each matching log line is an event
  tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep --line-buffered "ERROR"

  # Each file change is an event
  inotifywait -m --format '%e %f' /watched/dir

  # Poll GitHub for new PR comments and emit one line per new comment
  last=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
  while true; do
    now=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
    gh api "repos/owner/repo/issues/123/comments?since=$last" --jq '.[] | "\\(.user.login): \\(.body)"'
    last=$now; sleep 30
  done

  # Node script that emits events as they arrive (e.g. WebSocket listener)
  node watch-for-events.js

  # Per-occurrence with a natural end: emit each CI check as it lands, exit when the run completes
  prev=""
  while true; do
    s=$(gh pr checks 123 --json name,bucket)
    cur=$(jq -r '.[] | select(.bucket!="pending") | "\\(.name): \\(.bucket)"' <<<"$s" | sort)
    comm -13 <(echo "$prev") <(echo "$cur")
    prev=$cur
    jq -e 'all(.bucket!="pending")' <<<"$s" >/dev/null && break
    sleep 30
  done

**Don't use an unbounded command for a single notification.** \`tail -f\`, \`inotifywait -m\`, and \`while true\` never exit on their own, so the monitor stays armed until timeout even after the event has fired. For "tell me when X is ready," use Bash \`run_in_background\` with an \`until\` loop instead (one notification, ends in seconds). Note that \`tail -f log | grep -m 1 ...\` does *not* fix this: if the log goes quiet after the match, \`tail\` never receives SIGPIPE and the pipeline hangs anyway.

**Script quality:**
- Every pipe stage must flush per line or matches sit in its buffer unseen: \`grep\` needs \`--line-buffered\`, \`awk\` needs \`fflush()\`. \`head\` cannot flush at all — \`| head -N\` delivers nothing until N matches accumulate, then ends the stream.
- In poll loops, handle transient failures (\`curl ... || true\`) — one failed request shouldn't kill the monitor.
- Poll intervals: 30s+ for remote APIs (rate limits), 0.5-1s for local checks.
- Write a specific \`description\` — it appears in every notification ("errors in deploy.log" not "watching logs").
- Only stdout is the event stream. Stderr goes to the output file (readable via Read) but does not trigger notifications — for a command you run directly (e.g. \`python train.py 2>&1 | grep --line-buffered ...\`), merge stderr with \`2>&1\` so its failures reach your filter. (No effect on \`tail -f\` of an existing log — that file only contains what its writer redirected.)

**Coverage — silence is not success.** When watching a job or process for an outcome, your filter must match every terminal state, not just the happy path. A monitor that greps only for the success marker stays silent through a crashloop, a hung process, or an unexpected exit — and silence looks identical to "still running." Before arming, ask: *if this process crashed right now, would my filter emit anything?* If not, widen it.

  # Wrong — silent on crash, hang, or any non-success exit
  tail -f run.log | grep --line-buffered "elapsed_steps="

  # Right — one alternation covering progress + the failure signatures you'd act on
  tail -f run.log | grep -E --line-buffered "elapsed_steps=|Traceback|Error|FAILED|assert|Killed|OOM"

For poll loops checking job state, emit on every terminal status (\`succeeded|failed|cancelled|timeout\`), not just success. If you cannot confidently enumerate the failure signatures, broaden the grep alternation rather than narrow it — some extra noise is better than missing a crashloop.

**Output volume**: Every stdout line is a conversation message, so the filter should be selective — but selective means "the lines you'd act on," not "only good news." Never pipe raw logs; filter to exactly the success and failure signals you care about. Monitors that produce too many events are automatically stopped; restart with a tighter filter if this happens.

Stdout lines within 200ms are batched into a single notification, so multiline output from a single event groups naturally.

The script runs in the same shell environment as Bash. Exit ends the watch (exit code is reported). Timeout → killed. Set \`persistent: true\` for session-length watches (PR monitoring, log tails) — the monitor runs until you call TaskStop or the session ends. Use TaskStop to cancel early.`;
